# hw02_test_files
Input CSVs for testing Homework for COMS 327 (Fall 2015).

You can download all the files in their current state using the 'Download zip' at the bottom right at the page, if you are familiar with git I recommend you use that.

I have explained why files are invalid (or valid, though none are at this point in time) in the 'REASONINGS.md' if you find an error please do inform me (or better yet submit a pull request).
